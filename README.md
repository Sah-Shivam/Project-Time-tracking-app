# 🧑‍💻 Time Tracking Assignment 

This repository contains the full-stack implementation of the Time Tracking assignment. Below are the setup instructions to run both the **backend** and **frontend** locally.


## 📦 Backend Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name/backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file** in the `backend/` directory with the following variables:

   ```env
   MONGO_URI="your-mongodb-uri"
   PORT=5000
   ```

4. **Start the Server**

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

## 🚀 Frontend Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name/frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dev Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```


## 🔮 Future Scope

In future enhancements, we can implement a **session-based time tracking approach** instead of relying on manual input by users.
This would enable automatic tracking of user activity per project, allowing for more accurate insights into individual productivity across tasks.
